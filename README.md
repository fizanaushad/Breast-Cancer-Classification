# Breast-Cancer-Classification
CNN model for Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Classification.
📖 Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify breast histopathology images as either:

    Cancer (IDC Positive)

    No Cancer (IDC Negative)

The model is inspired by CancerNet, a lightweight CNN designed for medical image analysis.
It was trained on the Breast Histopathology Images Dataset from Kaggle and achieves good performance on unseen test samples.

📂 Dataset

Source: Breast Histopathology Images (Kaggle)

Description:

277,524 50×50 RGB patches from breast cancer histopathology slides.

Two classes:

    0 → IDC Negative (No Cancer)

    1 → IDC Positive (Cancer)

⚙️ Project Workflow

-> Data Preprocessing

-> Train / Validation / Test split

-> Normalization and augmentation (rotation, zoom, flips)

-> Model Architecture (CancerNet)

-> Convolutional layers with ReLU activation

-> MaxPooling layers

-> Fully connected dense layers

-> Softmax output for binary classification

-> Training

Optimizer: Adagrad

-> Loss: binary_crossentropy

-> Trained for 20–40 epochs

Evaluation: 

-> Accuracy

-> Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

-> Confusion Matrix

-> Prediction

-> Predicts on individual images or a batch of random images
📊 Results

Achieved > 80% accuracy on the validation set.

Clear separation between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue patches.
